# Soundcast Landuse Scenario Builder

This tool is used to modify Soundcast landuse inputs. Users can specify households totals for target zones and Soundcast-formatted inputs will be produced. Population distributions from Vision 2050 will be applied to all changes, which maintains underlying policy/forecast assumptions while allowing users to change detailed locations of households at a zonal level. This tool parcelizes these changes and updates Soundcast's synthetic population files to allow scenario testing.
